# Elm Portofolio
This is a simple web page showcasing a mock portofolio, and it utilises all of the important concepts in functional programming.

## What it does
Using the interactive development tool **elm reactor**, at http://localhost:8000/Main.elm, one may see a bare-bones version of a web page with static details at the top, 
followed by a list of mock events which can be filtered by category, and whose duration is calculated from the date fields. At the bottom, the top 5 repos by star 
reputaion can be seen, with data extracted from [BurntSushi](https://github.com/BurntSushi)'s GitHub. This data is extracted from the 
[json file](https://api.github.com/users/burntsushi/repos?sort=pushed) generated using the GitHub REST API.
